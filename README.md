# supervised-ml-from-scratch

This is a personal study repository.

While taking the Data Science Supervised Machine Learning in Python course, this repo houses my code for building these models from scratch.

The models include:
1. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Naive Bayes (NB)
3. Non Naive Bayes (Bayes)
4. Perceptron

All code is done in Python 3
